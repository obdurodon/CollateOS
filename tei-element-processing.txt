2014-01-26 djb updated to clarify "t" vs "n" versions, and to explore a
complication of internal markup in the TEI input files

2014-02-07 djb updated to include processing order

To process:
python preprocess-TEI.py
    reads input files from fixed directory and creates json.json output
collatex -t -o output.json json.json
    generates output collation as output.json from json.json input
python jsonToHTML.py
    converts output.json to semi-HTML testOut.html
saxon -o:final.html -s:testOut.html -xsl:initial-to-final-HTML.xsl
    fixes up testOut.html as final.html
View file using collate.css styling

Structure of json file expected by CollateX:

The "t" property of the JSON file to serve as input into CollateX should
retain all information present in the original TEI XML files. To create
the "n" property though, before applying the Soundex mappings, a copy of
the original TEI-tagged tokens should be processed as follows:

Inside TEI <choice>, get rid of the <choice> ... </choice> wrapper and
keep the second item in the following pairs, but not the tags:

<sic> / <corr>
<orig> / <reg>
<abbr> / <expan>

Keep the text content of the following TEI elements, but remove the tags:

<add>
<hi>
<unclear>

Exclude the contents of the following TEI elements, as well as the tags:

<del>
<gap>
<lb> (empty element)
<pb> (empty element, may have attributes)

There is a complication where markup may contain more than one logical
token, e.g.: <p>The <add>quick brown</add> fox. To create the "n" version
we just follow the rule above: keep the two words but strip the tags, 
which means that each word will naturally be a single token. The problem
for the "t" property is that we can't have the start tag in one location
and the end tag in another in the XML output, since that wouldn't be
well formed. Tentative strategy: we'll preprocess the TEI files before
creating the JSON version that will serve as input into CollateX, and the
preprocessing will split such examples, yielding something like:
<p>The <add>quick</add> <add>brown</add> fox</p>
