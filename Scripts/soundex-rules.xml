        process in this order: 
        strip all punctuation and convert everything to lower case
        strip <sup> start and </sup> end tags, so that superscript letters are treated as if not superscript
        strip <lacuna> and <lb> tags without a trace
            (there will be other rules about handling markup later)
        then, in this order, process the manyToOne, oneToMany, and oneToOne groups below
        then degeminate all geminate consonants (e.g., нн > н)
        then strip all non-word-initial vowels
        then truncate long words and right-pad with zero ("0") short words so that all representations are exactly four characters
