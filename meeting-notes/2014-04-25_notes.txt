Problem areas where CollateX misaligns
9,9 misaligns a perfect match
9,12 needs to move two columns
9,19 mismatches synonyms that share no characters (dictionary?)
9,23 needs to move several words in Tro to the left; CollateX pseudo-edit-distance may be screwing it up (try turning it off)
10,6 alignment of tsar/tsEsar

David will do:
djb needs to fix sja in paradosis!

Minas will do:
Turn off Levenshtein in CollateX: remove -l and -lt1 switches
Stop padding Soundex with 'X'
