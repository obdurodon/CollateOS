To deal with repetitions:

Modify Soundex normalization to add a digit if the preceding word is the same as the current one. 
That is, if two words in order would have the Soundex representation ABCD, make the second one
ABCD1. Complication: won't help if the repetition is a phrase of more than one word.

Defer: For end-of-word after lacuna, postprocess to find alignment where 1) not a Soundex match 
and 2) gap in the following position. In that case, reverse the words and do a Soundex normalization
from the end, matching the closest substring.

David:
Done: More data samples.
Defer: Modify XSLT to take XML, rather than pseudo-HTML, as input.
Defer: Write mss loci into TEI XML input. (defer: current samples have no mss loci)
Write units into TEI XML input.
Defer: Bdinski Abraham "syna brata" ~ "snovi" (one ~ two words)

Minas:
Modify Soundex to add digit in case of repetition.
Convert JSON output of CollateX to XML, preserving original TEI markup within words.
XML should include Soundex as attribute of word.
Specify input directory on command line; convention for default output filename and location,
which can be overridden on command line. Caters to selection of input files.
Driver (wrapper) script.
Copy CollateX files into working space to keep constant paths.
Defer: When mss loci are in TEI XML input, write them into the JSON output.
