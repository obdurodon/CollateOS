UX
==
Each block in its own XML file
Fetch with Ajax with click on complete paradosis
Fetch next or previous with scroll past edges
Problem: can't do full text search if only one block is visible at a time
Perspective: reader, not a searcher; you know what you want to read when you ask for the witnesses
Don't cache blocks; fetch them again
Separate browsing interface with separate XML file per column
Fix size of interlinear panel, sizing in ems
