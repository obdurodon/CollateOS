Minas fixed:
Delete old collatexoutput directory
Consolidated new and non-new options in runCollatex.py

Minas will fix:
Scripts should run from any directory:
  Before changing to Scripts directory, construct full path to input directory
  Directory specification should be relative to ms project directory, not to 
    Scripts or other CollateOS directory

David's homework:
Update documentation
  Input should be TEI
  Include sample XML input format; XSLT procedures on both ends
  Add dependencies for Preprocessing.py on *.xml files
  Get rid of <lacuna>, which is not a TEI element (check <unclear>, etc.)
Convert Scholia to TEI
Get rid of XMLSToJSON?

PyLing outline:
  D: Bring PVL books
  D: Describe research problem (collation and alignment of PVL)
  D: Describe CollateX, and why it needs help
  D: Describe Soundex-based normalization
  M Describe workflow:
    XML - JSON (Python)
    JSON - JSON (CollateX)
    JSON - XML (Python)
    XML - HTML (XSLT)
  D: Have documentation and files on line
  D: Working demo
  D: Specific research question?
  M: Things Minas learned to do in Python
  M: Reflect on whether it could all have been done in Python (yes) or XSLT (no, because we 
    couldn't spawn a collatex process)
