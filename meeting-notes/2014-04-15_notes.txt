Questions:
Do we pad short word with X? Answer: yes
Do we remove vowels from short words?
Do we leave edit distance on in CollateX?
(If we remove vowels from short words and leave ED on, everything matches.)

Try: 
Keep vowels in 1- and 2-letter words, but pad with X
Leave edit distance on
Doesn't fix m-words in 9,2
Postprocess to catch remaining mismatches:

Algorithm:
In blocks that have gaps, rows without gaps define possible values for columns (get rid of duplicate values)
In rows that have gaps, compare ED of word preceding gap from all possible values in that column and the following on, place the word with the closest fit

Test cases:
3,5: edit distance (Thracians)
9,2: short matches; m-words
12,21: overlapping transpositions

David will do:
Fix type on 9,2 (po)
