To run wrapper: python wrapper.py { XMLtoJSON.py | XMLStoJSON.py } -i input-directory 
In case of XMLStoJSON, also specify -o output-directory
Optional in both cases: -new (creates collatexoutput directory, does not overwrite original JSON files)

XMLStoJSON reads TEI XML, eventually yields XML objects (each file is its own witness, as with Scolia)
XMLtoJSON reads TEI XML (each file contains multiple witnesses, as with PVL)
